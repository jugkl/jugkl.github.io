<p class="event-abstract">
    In cooperation between Chaos in KL e.V., JUG-KL and Softwerkskammer RLP, a Code Retreat-Event will take place on the Global Day of Code Retreat -
    for the first time in Kaiserslautern. Code Retreat means retreat from the usual project-driven programming and focus
    on the elementary elements of programming like Clean Code or TDD. One and the same task will be worked on under different
    conditions again and again together with changing partners in pair-programming. The approach and programming language
    is freely selectable.
