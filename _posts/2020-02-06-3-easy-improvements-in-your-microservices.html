<p class="event-abstract">
    While microservices offer better scalability, they actually decrease performance and resiliency.
    I’ll show 3 areas in which it’s possible to cope with that.

    While a microservices architecture is more scalable than a monolith, it has a direct hit on performance.
    <br><br>
    To cope with that, one performance improvement is to set up a cache.
    It can be configured for database access, for REST calls or just to store session state across a cluster of server nodes.
    In this demo-based talk, I’ll show how Hazelcast In-Memory Data Grid can help you in each one of those areas and how to configure it. Hint: it’s much easier than one would expect.
